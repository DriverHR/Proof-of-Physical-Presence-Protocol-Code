Proof of Physical Presence Protocol System and Method for Proving the Presence of a Person Using Data Over Audio and Biometrics
ABSTRACT: A system and method for proving the presence of a person at a specific location in time and space using data over audio and biometrics. The system utilizes ultrasonic tones called smart tones to capture a unique identifier that can be hashed and minted as an ERC721 asset. This asset, called a hashed smartone, is tied biometrically to the person, such as through a fingerprint or retinal scan, and can be stored as a decentralized identifier (DID) in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The system can be used in various applications, such as in ride sharing transactions, where it can prove that a person was physically present at a specific location at a specific time.

DESCRIPTION:

The present invention relates to a system and method for proving the presence of a person at a specific location in time and space using data over audio and biometrics.

In one embodiment, the system includes a platform for capturing a unique identifier through the use of ultrasonic tones called smart tones. These smart tones can be modulated to transmit a unique identifier that can be captured and hashed to form a hashed smartone. The hashed smartone can serve as an ERC721 asset or non-fungible token (NFT) and can be tied biometrically to the person, such as through a fingerprint or retinal scan. The hashed smartone can also be stored as a decentralized identifier (DID) in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).

The system can be used in various applications, such as in ride sharing transactions, where it can prove that a person was physically present at a specific location at a specific time. The system utilizes space, time, and geo-location, as well as biometrics, to authenticate the presence of a person.

The present invention offers numerous benefits over prior art systems, including improved security and transparency in proving the presence of a person, as well as the ability to easily and efficiently verify the presence of a person at a specific location in time and space.

The foregoing description of the invention is intended to be illustrative and not limiting. Other variations of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the disclosure provided above and the attached drawings. The invention is defined by the claims and their full scope of equivalents
